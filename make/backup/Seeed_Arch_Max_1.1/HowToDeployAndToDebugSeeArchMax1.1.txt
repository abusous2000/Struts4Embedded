For some reason, this is the only way I was able to make it work. 
It is little not normal... but at least it enables you to debug

 1-install pyocd vi pip
   pip install -U pyocd
   python2.7 what worked form me. See this for details
 2-copy ch.bin to Seed's DAPLINK drive; as any mbed app deployment
   2.2.press & hold the reset button for few seconds
   2.1-sometimes you have to unplug the board from power
   2.3 always before debugging, look at the serial console to make sure that u see the newer code
 3-run pyocd gdb
 4-Then from ChibiStodio open debugger as normal
 5-Always verify that you are running the latest code
 6-Monitor serial USB for debug output

now every time you change your code, u need to copy the ch.bin file to Seeed manual as in step 2.
