 If you decide to use *[IR Receiver](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/tree/master/source/Controls/IRReceiver)* to send control signals via *[1838 Modules](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/4000516220084.html)*, please note the following:
   - The library is designed to receive frames from this type of [remote](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1734458680.html). If you decide to use other type of remote, then you have decipher/decode its signals as [described here](https://www.playembedded.org/blog/ir-remote-and-stm32-using-chibios/).
   - The library is designed to be re-usable with minimally dependencies on [S4E](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded). It is dependent on [these parameters e PORTABLE_ICU_*](https://github.com/abusous2000/MP3PlayerUsingSTM32F7/blob/master/cfg/stm32f769i_discovery/Strust4EmbeddedConf.h#L100) in the config file.
   - So far it has been tested with STM32F769i board; I am almost sure it works with all others.
   - Please override method *[handleIREvent()](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/blob/master/source/Controls/IRReceiver/IRReceiver.c#L103)* as you see *[here](https://github.com/abusous2000/MP3PlayerUsingSTM32F7/blob/master/main.c#L227)* to handle incoming event. Don't change the original since it is designed to be override the /weak method.
