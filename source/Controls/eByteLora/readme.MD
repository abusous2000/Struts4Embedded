 If you decide to use *[eByte Lora](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/tree/master/source/Controls/eByteLora)* to send control signals via *[eByte Lora Modules](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/4000516220084.html)*, please note the following:
   - The library is designed to send a [Lora Frame](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/blob/master/source/Controls/eByteLora/EByteLora.h#L224), that includes a payload.
   - the payload could be [overridden in the configuration file](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/blob/master/cfg/stm32f446re_nucleo/Strust4EmbeddedConf.h#L113). By the default the payload sends the state of [8 buttons plus the value of a single POT](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/blob/master/source/Controls/eByteLora/EByteLora.h#L238). This easily could be extended or overridden in the config file.
   - by default the maximum payload size is limited to 40 bytes. Easily you can override this in the config file. Note that eByte limits the total frame size to 512.
   - Note that the *[Fixed Transmission](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/blob/master/source/Controls/eByteLora/EByteLora.c#L245)* feature has been implemented, where the transmitter can specify receivers address & channel per frame.
   - On frame reception, the library sends [acknowledgement message](https://github.com/abusous2000/Struts4Embedded/blob/master/source/Controls/eByteLora/EByteLora.c#L322) by default.
